# Traffic-Sign-Detection
Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) revolutionize road safety by integrating cutting-edge technologies into vehicles. Among its pivotal components is Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR), a vital feature enhancing driver awareness and compliance with traffic regulations. TSR employs machine learning algorithms to detect and interpret traffic signs from images or video streams captured by onboard cameras. This project focuses on developing a robust TSR system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately recognize and classify traffic signs in real-time scenarios. By leveraging deep learning techniques and extensive dataset training, the goal is to enhance driving safety and efficiency by providing timely and accurate traffic sign information to drivers.
